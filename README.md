A set of routines for analysis of Ca dynamics in fluorescent microscopy data.
Supported by RSF grant #17-74-20089 in 2017-2020

This repository is a collection of tools for analysis of Ca transients, from 1D-signals (e.g. as exported from ROIs) to dynamical imaging and spatiotemporal events.

1D-handling includes estimation of time-varying baseline fluorescence and time-varying noise level as well as detection and reconstruction of Ca-transients.

Dynamical imaging (video) handing includes routines for estimating full-frame time-varying baseline level, and a set of patch-based transformations of the raw data.

A demo jupyter notebook will be added inf the future.
