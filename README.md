A set of routines for analsyis of Ca dynamics in fluorescent microscopy data.
Supported by RSF grant №17-74-20089

This repository is a collection of tools for analysis of Ca transients, from 1D-signals (e.g. as exported from ROIs) to dynamical imaging and spatiotemporal events. 

1D-handling includes estimation of time-varying baseline fluorescence and time-varying noise level as well as detection and resconstruction of Ca-transients.

Dynamical imaging (video) handing includes routines for estimating full-frame time-varying baseline level, and a set of patch-based transformations of the raw data. 

A demo jupyter notebook will be added soon.
